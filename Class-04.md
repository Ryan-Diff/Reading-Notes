# Chapter 4: Links

    * Links are created using the <a> element.

    * The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

    *If you are linking to a page within your own site, its best to use the relative links rather than qualified URLs.

    * You can create links to open email programs with an email adress in the 'to' field. 

    * You can use the ID attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to. 

        

    
# Chapter 15: Layout

    * <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page. 
 
    * Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.  

    * The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create a multi-column layouts. 

        * Floated items require a defined width. 

    * Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.  

    * Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600px.

        * This shows the sites relevance without having to scroll.

    * Grids help create professional and flexible designs. 

    * CSS frameworks provide rules for common tasks. 

    * You can include multiple CSS files in one page.  

# Chapter 3: Functions, Methods and Objects
    
    * Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 

    * Functions can take parameters, or information required to do their job, and may return a value. 

    * An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 

    * In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
