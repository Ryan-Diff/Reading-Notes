# Chapter 3: Lists

    * There are three typers of HTML lists.

        * Ordered lists <ol> - Uses numbers.

        * Unorderd lists <ul> - Uses bullets

        * Definition - Lists used to define terminology.

    * Lists can be nested inside one another.     


    
# Chapter 13: Boxes

    * CSS will treat each HTML element as its own box.

    * Using CSS will allow you to control the dimensions of a box. 

    * For each box you can adjust borders, margins and padding.

    * You can hide the element boxes using display and visibility properties. 

    * You can display inline boxes or block level boxes. 

    * Adjusting the width and height can improve legibility for users. 

    * CSS3 allows the user to add borders or rounded edges to images. 

# Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops
    * Conditional statements allow code to make decisions on what to do next. 

    * Comparison operators are used to compare two operands. 
        * ===
        * !==
        * ==
        * !=
        * <>
        * <= , =>

    * Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
    
    * If-Else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true and another set if it is false.

    * Switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes and provides a default option if none match. 

    * Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

    * All values evaluate to either truthy or falsey (Booleans).

    * There are three types of loop: for, while and do...while. Each repeats a set of statements.
