    * In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

# Chapter 5: Document Object Model

    * The browser represents the page using the DOM tree.

    * DOM trees have four types of nodes:

        * Document nodes

        * Element nodes

        * Attribute nodes

        * Text nodes

    * You can select element nodes by ID or class attributes, by tag name, or using the CSS selector syntax.

    * Whenever a DOM query can return a NodeList

    * From an element node you can acess and update its content using properties suck as textcontent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation.

    * An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of eachother. 

    * In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent

    * Browsers offer tools for viewing the dom tree
