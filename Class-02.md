# Chapter 10: Introducing CSS
    *CSS allows you to create rulses that specify how the content of that element should appear.

    *Contains a Selector and a Declaration

        *The Selector specifies the elements the rule will apply to.

        *The Declaration indicate what the element should look like.

        *Different types of Selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

        *The Declaration is made of two parts...

            *The values of those properties. 

    
# Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

    * A script is made of a series of statements, each statement is like a step in a recipie. 
     
    * You can specify values even if you dont use them right away.

    * Vars are used to temporarily store pieces of information in a script.

    * JS take in 'STRINGS', booleans and numbers. 

    * An array is a special variable that can store more than one piece of information.

    *Expressions evaluate to a single value. 

    *Expression rely on operators to calculate a value. 

# Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops
    * Conditional statements allow code to make decisions on what to do next. 

    * Comparison operators are used to compare two operands. 
        * ===
        * !==
        * ==
        * !=
        * <>
        * <= , =>

    * Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
    
    * If-Else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true and another set if it is false.
